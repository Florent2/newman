This is going to be an experiment in building a simple framework for developing
email-based applications. It is based on ideas from an exercise in 
Mendicant University's January 2012 core skills course, and also serves as a
demo application for an article in the Practicing Ruby Journal.

### For a demonstration of how Newman is used:

Check out [Jester](http://github.com/mendicant-university/jester) as well as some of the
simple examples in this repository.
