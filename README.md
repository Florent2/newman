Newman exists to make building simple email based applications as easy as
Sinatra makes building simple web applications, and to make sharing useful email
processing extensions as easy as Rack makes sharing web framework extensions.

### For a demonstration of how Newman is used:

Check out [Jester](http://github.com/mendicant-university/jester) as well as some of the
simple examples in this repository.
