Newman is a microframework which aims to do for email-based 
applications what Rack and Sinatra have done for web programming. It is
currently in its very early experimental stages, and is not suitable for use in
production. 

That said, it is already capable of a number of interesting things:

### For a demonstration of how Newman is used:

Check out [Jester](http://github.com/mendicant-university/jester) as well as some of the
simple examples in this repository.
